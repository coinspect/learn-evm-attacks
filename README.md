# <h1 align="center"> Learn EVM Attacks </h1>
A collection of Foundry tests reproducing exploits, bug bounty reports, and theoretical vulnerabilities on EVM chains. Diagrams and context links accompany each attack reproduction to make it more helpful as a reference or study material for anyone trying to learn more about vulnerabilities in smart contract systems.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Some tests need access to archive data as they require state from old blocks. If a test is failing, make sure to set up an archive node as the JSON-RPC URL in `foundry.toml`. [Infura](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/ethereum/concepts/archive-data) provides free access to archive data.

Want to take a quick look? Just go to a vulnerability folder (say, [MBCToken](/test/Access_Control/MBCToken)). Read the README or jump ahead to running the reproduction in your computer! You only need [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) installed. 

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/coinspect/learn-evm-attacks
$ forge install
$ forge test --match-contract Exploit_MBCToken -vvv
```

## Index

We now have 40 reproduced exploits. Of those 40, we have chosen a few in case you want to start studying up with some of the most interesting ones.

- **[Tornado Cash Governance Takeover](/test/Business_Logic/TornadoCash_Governance)** is an excellent way to show the dangers of `DELEGATECALL` and the perils of governance systems.
- **[Furucombo](/test/Business_Logic/Furucombo)** _another_ excellent way to show the dangers of `DELEGATECALL`.
- **[MBC Token](/test/Access_Control/MBCToken)** is a primer on how sandwich attacks can be made with an interesting backstory on suspicious tokenomics. 
- **[Uranium](/test/Business_Logic/Uranium)** is a great excuse to study up on the actual code that guards the famouse AMM constant product `x*y=k`.

To run an specific exploit, you can just use:

``` bash
forge test --match-contract Exploit_MBCToken -vvv
```

Vary the amount of verbosity (`-v`, `-vv`...) according to the data you want. `-vvvv` includes traces!

# <h2 align="center"> Contributing </h2>

To contribute, create a new file inside the most appropriate category. Use the `template.txt` file in the `test` folder including the information related to the attack.

Utils that perform flashloans and swaps are provided in `test/utils` to ease the job of reproducing future attacks. Also, modules that provide enhanced features to Foundry are included in the `test/modules` folder. 

The tests should `pass` if the attacker succeeded, for examples: your requires should show that the attacker has more balance after the attack than before.

# <h2 align="center"> Past work and further study </h2>

- [DefiHackLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs) has a similar repository with more exploits and more focus on the test reproductions alone, with no context or further explanations. It is nevertheless great if you only care about the attack reproductions! Go check it out.

## Troubleshooting

The main reason why tests fail is due to failures on the RPC providers we have set up as defaults. Please either:

- Try again
- Change the corresponding provider in the `foundry.toml`

If a reproduction is _still_ failing (ie: it reverts), try to:

- Clean Forge's cache: `forge cache clean`
- Update Foundry: `foundryup`
