## Step-by-step 
1. Call `initialize` to set your own `forge_` address
2. Call `withdrawToForge` to withdraw tokens

## Detailed Description
The Punk protocol pools did not prevent someone from calling `initialize` after
the contracts were already initialized.

The attacker called `initialize` through the proxy and set their own `forge_` address, which allowed them to later call `withdrawToForge`, which, as the name implies, withdraws all the funds to the forge address.

``` solidity
    function initialize( 
        address forge_, 
        address token_,
        address cToken_, 
        address comp_, 
        address comptroller_,
        address uRouterV2_ ) public {
    }
```

## Possible mitigations
- `initialize` functions should always be protected so they can be called only once
